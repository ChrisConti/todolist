### Analytics to Add

## Troubleshooting

### "No tasks to export"
- Make sure you have a baby profile selected
- Create some tasks before exporting

### "Sharing not available"
- Device may not support file sharing
- Try updating iOS/Android to latest version

### Excel showing garbled text
- The CSV uses UTF-8 with BOM specifically for Excel
- If issues persist, try opening in Google Sheets first, then copying to Excel

### File not found after export
- Check your device's Downloads folder
- Check Files app (iOS) or My Files (Android)
- File may be in temporary storage - import it immediately after export

## Testing

To test the export feature:
1. Create a baby profile
2. Add various types of tasks with different dates
3. Go to Settings â†’ Export Tasks
4. Try different time periods
5. Verify CSV opens correctly in Excel/Sheets
6. Check that all data is correctly formatted
7. Verify date/time formats match locale
